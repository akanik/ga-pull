Steps and code for pulling Google Analytics into Google Sheets

## Setup

There are several configuration steps that you will need to go through in order to enable Google Sheets (GS) to pull Google Analytics (GA) code.

NOTE: The Google account that creates the spreadsheet must be the same Google account that has GA access.

1. Create a new Google spreadsheet. Name it something creative like **analytics-dashboard**
2. Click `Tools > Script Editor`
