I could not have figured out much of this without the help of tanaikech's article [Linking Cloud Platform Project to Google Apps Script Project](https://tanaikech.github.io/2019/07/05/linking-cloud-platform-project-to-google-apps-script-project/).

Google has put out a very helpful [Query Explorer](https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/query-explorer/). If you're having trouble formating your queries, playing with the query explorer can be helpful.
