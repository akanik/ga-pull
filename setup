# Setup

In order to get the code working, we need to run through a few setup steps.

## 1. Create a new Google spreadsheet. 
Name it something creative like **analytics-dashboard**


## 2. Enable Scripts
Click `Tools > Script Editor`

A new tab should open up that looks like this:

Name your project something awesome like **metrix-pullin**.


## 3. Activate APIs
On your new code tab, select `Resources > Advanced Google Services`

Find the line that says Google Analytics API and make sure that it’s toggled to the  `ON`  position.

**DON’T CLICK OK YET**. See that yellow box telling you to enable services in the Google Cloud Platform API Dashboard? Click _that_ link.

> Don’t panic if you get a screen that looks like this:

> 
> It just means that the Developer Console tried to open up using the wrong Google account. Look at the top right of the page at your account icon and make sure it reflects the appropriate account.

If you’re using the correct account, you should see something like this:

Click `ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES`.

In the search bar, search for _Analytics_.

Click on the `Analytics API`. (NOTE: Not Google Analytics Reporting API)

Click `ENABLE` (_If the API is already enabled, it will say `MANAGE` instead of `ENABLE`_)

Head back to the code tab. You should still have this popup window visible:

Now you can click `OK`.
